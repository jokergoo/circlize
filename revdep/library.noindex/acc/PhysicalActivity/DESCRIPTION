Description: It provides a function "wearingMarking" for classification of monitor
    wear and nonwear time intervals in accelerometer data collected to assess
    physical activity. The package also contains functions for making plot for 
    accelerometer data and obtaining the summary of various information including 
    daily monitor wear time and the mean monitor wear time during valid days.      
    The revised package version 0.2-1 improved the functions in the previous version
    regarding speed and robustness. In addition, several functions were added: 
    "markDelivery" can classify days for ActiGraph delivery by mail; 
    "markPAI" can categorize physical activity intensity level based on user-defined 
    cut-points of accelerometer counts. It also supports importing ActiGraph AGD files 
    with "readActigraph" and "queryActigraph" functions. The package also better supports
    time zones and daylight saving.
