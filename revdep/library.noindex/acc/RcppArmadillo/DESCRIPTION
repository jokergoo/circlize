Description: 'Armadillo' is a templated C++ linear algebra library (by Conrad
 Sanderson) that aims towards a good balance between speed and ease of use. Integer,
 floating point and complex numbers are supported, as well as a subset of
 trigonometric and statistics functions. Various matrix decompositions are
 provided through optional integration with LAPACK and ATLAS libraries.
 The 'RcppArmadillo' package includes the header files from the templated
 'Armadillo' library. Thus users do not need to install 'Armadillo' itself in
 order to use 'RcppArmadillo'. From release 7.800.0 on, 'Armadillo' is
 licensed under Apache License 2; previous releases were under licensed as
 MPL 2.0 from version 3.800.0 onwards and LGPL-3 prior to that;
 'RcppArmadillo' (the 'Rcpp' bindings/bridge to Armadillo) is licensed under
 the GNU GPL version 2 or later, as is the rest of 'Rcpp'. Note that
 Armadillo requires a fairly recent compiler; for the g++ family at least
 version 4.6.* is required.
