Title: Mixed GAM Computation Vehicle with Automatic Smoothness
        Estimation
Description: Generalized additive (mixed) models, some of their extensions and 
             other generalized ridge regression with multiple smoothing 
             parameter estimation by (Restricted) Marginal Likelihood, 
             Generalized Cross Validation and similar. Includes a gam() 
             function, a wide variety of smoothers, JAGS support and 
             distributions beyond the exponential family.
